                    <h3>Kyiv</h3>
                    <p>In the beginning there was Kyiv. Long before Ukraine and Russia existed, the city's
                      inhabitants were already striding up and down the green hills, idling hot afternoons away on the Dnipro River
                      and promenading along Khreshchatyk - then a stream, now the main avenue. Kyiv, one of the few European hidden gems left that have yet been infiltrated by over-tourism,
                      is one of those cities that will leave you wanting more by the end fo your trip.

                    <h3>Odesa</h3>
                    <p>Due to its strategic location on the coast of the Black Sea, Odesa had seen many occupants that came and went.
                      What remains is Odesa and its population of refugees and foreigners that built the city from the ground up and made it what it is today.
                      From Turkish influence to Slavs and Western European influences, Odesa is a type of cities you have never seen before.
                      One house in the same neighborhood might have Gothic architectural-style whereas the one next to it might have Brutalism architectural-style from the Soviet-era,
                      and another next to it with a touch of the colorful Ottoman-Turkish influence. This is Odesa.</p>
