## Design

### Design Choices
The web page has been designed keeping in mind the first expression that the customer may have during his first perception. The first look captures the mountain landscape at sunrise with Burnt Maroon color for logo and navigation. Scrolling down the page, the user gets to the significant places section on a soft green (light shade of green) background, which makes customer to stay longer on the website and calmly enjoy the view of the place due to calm shades of the page. 
A minimalist style was chosen for the shop page in order to keep the customer's eye on the products rather than overall view, where photos of souvenirs with a Burnt Maroon title are placed on a white background.
### Colour
For the colour sheme maroon tones were chosen to match the most important information on the page and also the media elements in the footer. The main section with significant places highlighted with a soft green color. Contacts were highlighted with calmly shade of cyan. To narrow down the colours I used Adobe Color.
